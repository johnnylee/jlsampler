<h2>JLSampler: Documentation</h2>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>
<b>(a)</b>
Create a directory in your home folder named <code>.jlsampler</code>.  
</p>

<p>
<b>(b)</b>
Create the file <code>~/.jlsampler/config.js</code> with content:
</p>

<pre>
{
    "MidiIn": "20;0"
}
</pre>

<p>
You can find your device and port number by running the command 
<code>aconnect -io</code>. The format of the string is client:port. You can 
manually connect ports using the <code>aconnect</code> command. In fact, 
JLSampler simply calls aconnect with the given string when it starts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>(c)</b>
Create the file <code>~/.jlsampler/controls.js</code> with content:
</p>

<pre>
[
    {
        "Name": "Sustain",
        "Num": 64,
        "Min": 0,
        "Max": 1,
        "Gamma": 1
    }
]
</pre>

<p>
If you are using a standard midi keyboard or digital piano, this will
bind your sustain pedal to the <code>Sustain</code> control in JLSampler. 
</p>

<p>
<b>(d)</b>
Download a <a href="samples.html">sample set</a> and extract the files to 
a location of your choice. Be sure to maintain the directory structure 
when you extract the files. 
</p>

<p>
<b>(e)</b>
Make sure <code>jackd</code> is running, then change into the sample-set 
directory and run:
</p>

<pre>
jlsampler . 
</pre>

<p>
<b>(f)</b>
Use <code>qjackctl</code>  to connect the sampler's outputs to your 
system's outputs.
</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p>
Controls can be modified from the command line using the syntax 
<code>Control=Value</code> where the value is a floating point number. 
Controls can also be bound to midi controls through the configuration 
file in the same manner as the sustain control shown above. 
</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>Transpose</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>Added to midi note key values.</dd>

<dt><b>PitchBendMax</b> (1)</dt>
<dd>The maximum pitch bend in semitones.</dd>

<dt><b>RRBorrow</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>Borrow notes from adjacent samples up to the given distance.
This is applied when loading, and can't be called after that. 
</dd>

<dt><b>Tau</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>The key-off decay time constant in seconds. 0 disables.</dd>

<dt><b>TauCut</b> (0)</dt>    
<dd>The key-repeat or cut decay time constant in seconds. 0 disables.</dd>

<dt><b>TauFadeIn</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>The sample fade-in time constant in seconds. 0 disables.</dd>

<dt><b>CropThresh</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>Crop the start of samples below this threshold. 
This is in the range [0, 1].
</dd>

<dt><b>RmsTime</b> (0.25)</dt>
<dd>Time in seconds over which to compute the sample RMS value. 
This is used to normalize the amplitude of samples to provide smooth 
transitions between velocity layers and across the keyboard.
</dd>

<dt><b>RmsLow</b> (0.20)</dt>
<dd>Peak RMS value for key 21</b> (Low A) on a keyboard. For a piano a good 
place to start is 0.2. The RMS value for each note is linearly interpolated
across the keyboard. This provides a smooth response when moving from 
low to high notes on the keyboard, and matches fairly well with what 
I've measured from a Yamaha digital piano.
</dd>

<dt><b>RmsHigh</b> (0.04)</dt>
<dd>Peak RMS value for key 108 (High C) on a keyboard. For a piano a 
good place to start is 0.04.
</dd>

<dt><b>PanLow</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>Pan value for key 21 on 88 key keyboard (low A). -1 is hard left and 1 
is hard right. The pan value for each note is linearly interpolated from 
the `PanLow` and `PanHigh` values.
</dd>

<dt><b>PanHigh</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>Like PanLow but for key 108 (high C).</dd>

<dt><b>GammaAmp</b> (2.2)</dt>
<dd>The scaling of volume with key velocity. If velocity is scaled from zero 
to one, then the amplitude is scaled like velocity^gamma. I've found 2.2 to
be a good starting value. I found that value by measuring the 
amplitude -vs- velocity curve of a Yamaha stage piano.
</dd>

<dt><b>GammaLayer</b> (1)</dt>
<dd>Just like GammaAmp, but for selecting the velocity layer (sample). 
This will really depend on how the samples were captured. I've seen sample 
sets with gamma on both sides of 1.
</dd>

<dt><b>VelMult</b> (1)</dt>
<dd>Multiplier for incoming midi velocity. I have one keyboard that 
I have a very hard time reaching velocity levels of 100 out of 127.
</dd>

<dt><b>MixLayers</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>If true, the sampler will mix smoothly between velocity layers. This 
can be useful for certain types of prepared samples. Adjust GammaLayer to
control the layer mix with respect to velocity. 
</dd>

<dt><b>FakeLayerRC</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>This is used to add some dynamics to single-layered samples. If true, a 
zero-velocity layer is created by applying an RC low-pass filter to each 
sample. This is generally used in conjunction with MixLayers=true. A good
starting point for GammaLayer is 2.2 when using this setting. 
</dd>

<dt><b>Sustain</b> (0)</dt>
<dd>This should be connected to your sustain pedal.</dd>

<h3>Configuration files</h3>

<p>
Configuration files are stored in <code>~/.jlsampler</code>. 
Currently there are two files: 
<code>config.js</code> and <code>controls.js</code>. These are both JSON files.
</p>

<h4>config.js</h4>

<p>
<code>config.js</code> currently contains a single configuration variable. 
</p>

<pre>
{
    "MidiIn": "20:0",
}
</pre>

<h4>controls.js</h4>
<p>
<code>controls.js</code> maps midi controls to the controls listed above. 
Below is an example file with two bindings. Other controls are bound in the 
same manner. 
```
</p>

<pre>
[
    {
        "Name": "Sustain", 
        "Num": 64,
        "Min": 0,
        "Max": 1,
        "Gamma": 1.0
    }, {
        "Name": "PitchBendMax",
        "Num": 11,
        "Min": 1,
        "Max": 12,
        "Gamma": 1
    }
]
</pre>

<h3>Sample Sets</h3>

<p>
A sample set is contained in a directory with the following format:
</p>

<pre>
my-sample-set/
    samples/    # Contains samples.
    defaults.js # Default control values for the sample set. 
    tuning.js   # Tuning information for each file. 
</pre>

<p>
Samples are stored as FLAC files, and have names of the form:
<code>on-[note]-[layer]-[variation].flac</code>.
